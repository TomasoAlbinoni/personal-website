                In 2022, I joined the Sunobi team as a back-end developer. However, I quickly started working on the Unity client. Sunobi was an exhilarating place to work, with demanding requirements that were frequently changing as I was writing code. It required the ability to learn quickly, solve complex problems quickly and respond quickly when plans changed.

                <p className="mb-3">In a previous life, I worked as a freelance translator. Translation agencies typically send a translation memory along with the files to be translated. Many translation agencies favored the translation tool Trados Studio, and distributed translation memories in the proprietary .sdltm format. I resisted using Trados Studio because it was both expensive and unpleasant to work with, opting instead for memoQ. The problem was that at the time, memoQ could not import .sdltm files. To solve this problem, I wrote a file conversion utility in Java. A .sdltm file is really a SQLite database, so I could extract the translation units and convert them to the standard, XML-based .tmx format, which is universally supported.</p>
                <p className="mb-3">Later, I added the ability to convert Trados Studio termbases, again to a universal format.</p>
                <p>I made my converter available for free on my website. It helped a lot of translators, as it was downloaded over 1000 times.</p>
